# MachineLearning
Included is a collection of my machine learning projects as well as my homework assignments for the online Machine Learning course offered by Stanford through coursera programmed in Matlab.  

# Table of Contents 
1. [MachineLearning](#MachineLeanring)

# Machine Learning
Python modules that implement various machine learning models such as linear regression, logisitic regression, and neural network.  Adadelta.py is a modified gradient descent type algorithm (arXiv:1212.5701). The machine learning modules contain examples that reproduce results from the Matlab coursera homework assignments. Supervised.py combines three mentioned modules.
